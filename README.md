# Periodic Table Database

This project includes a shell script (`element.sh`) that queries a PostgreSQL database to retrieve information about chemical elements. The database contains details about elements, their properties, and types.

## Project Structure

- `element.sh`: A shell script used to query the periodic table database.
- `periodic_table.sql`: A SQL file that contains the schema and data for the periodic table database.
- `.gitignore`: Specifies files and directories to be ignored by Git.
- `README.md`: This file.

## Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd periodic_table
   ```

2. **Initialize the Database**

   Ensure you have PostgreSQL installed. Create and initialize the database using the provided SQL file.

   ```bash
   psql --username=freecodecamp --dbname=periodic_table < periodic_table.sql
   ```

3. **Make the Script Executable**

   Ensure that `element.sh` is executable. You can set the executable permission with the following command:

   ```bash
   chmod +x element.sh
   ```

## Usage

### Querying the Database

You can use `element.sh` to query the periodic table database. The script accepts either an atomic number, a chemical symbol, or an element name as an argument.

- **Query by Atomic Number**

  ```bash
  ./element.sh 1
  ```

- **Query by Symbol**

  ```bash
  ./element.sh H
  ```

- **Query by Name**

  ```bash
  ./element.sh Hydrogen
  ```

### Output

The script will output information about the element including its atomic number, symbol, name, type, mass, melting point, and boiling point. If the element is not found or if no argument is provided, the script will output an appropriate error message.

## Example

```bash
$ ./element.sh H
The element with atomic number 1 is Hydrogen (H). It's a nonmetal, with a mass of 1.008 amu. Hydrogen has a melting point of -259.1 celsius and a boiling point of -252.9 celsius.
```
